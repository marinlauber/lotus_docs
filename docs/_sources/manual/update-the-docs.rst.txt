 Updating the documentation
****************************

**If you are given help from a more experienced user, you are expected to put that information into the lotus documentation.**

The documentation is built with `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_. The content is written in a series of text files in `~Dropbox/LotusDocumentation/source` in a `markdown`-like language for simple formatting. This is compiled into html using ``make`` and python script.

Looking at the Sphinx website and the source files should be enough to figure out the basics.

Good luck, and thanks for the help!
