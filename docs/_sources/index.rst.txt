This documantation is intended to help users get started with the code. Following this documentation should allow you to install the code, run some simple simulations (on a single core or in parallel), and hopefully make some extensions for your use case. If and when you need something that is not in the documentation, please ask someone more familiar with the code and then update-the-docs so the next person won't have to ask.
